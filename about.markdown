I work as an audio researcher in perceptual audio signal processing, currently with the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS)](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in Germany, and the [International Audio Laboratories Erlangen](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fraunhofer/assistant/delgado).

For the last ten years, I’ve been working on audio signal processing algorithms that ended up in various products and patents, and I also participated in numerous standardisation activities in audio telecommunications. I defended my [doctoral thesis](https://open.fau.de/items/b9a42c3a-9f0d-4012-9cbd-4e5e27131042) on auditory perceptual models for audio quality measurement and audio coding under the supervision of Jürgen Herre and Thomas Sporer (as dissertation jury)
two of the inventors in the core development team of the [MP3 format]((https://www.mp3-history.com/en/the_mp3_team.html)).

I hold memberships for the IEEE and an Audio Engineering Society (AES). I am also part of the Audio Engineering Society Technical Committees (AES-TC) on [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI)](https://www.aes.org/technical/mlai), [Coding of Audio Signals (CAS)](https://www.aes.org/technical/cas) and [Perception and Subjective Evaluation of Audio signals (PSEAS)](https://www.aes.org/technical/pseas) and invited reviewer of the [Journal of the Audio Engineering Society](https://aes2.org/publications/journal/), the [IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (TASL)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6570655) and the [IEEE Signal Processing Letters (SPL)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=97).

Having been born and raised in the global south, where technology development is minimal and opportunities are scarce, I owe my international career to the high-quality public and free education I received. As a proud graduate of the [University of Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires), I am a **firm believer in the right of access to a quality public education for everyone**.
