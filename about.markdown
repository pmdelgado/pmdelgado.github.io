Hi,

I am Pablo, I work as an audio researcher in perceptual audio signal processing, currently with the [Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS)](http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de) in Germany, and the [International Audio Laboratories Erlangen](http://www.audiolabs.uni-erlangen.de).  For the last ten years, I’ve been working on audio signal processing algorithms that ended up in various products and patents, and I also participated in numerous standardisation activities in audio telecommunications. I defended my doctoral thesis on auditory perceptual models for audio quality measurement and audio coding under the supervision of Jürgen Herre, one of the inventors of the MP3 format.
